<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->

Filling of forms is sometimes a tedious process especially when the form originates in an unfamiliar language. Even if the form is translated, the process of actually filling in the details is prone to human error and misinterpretation. This project is to develop a system that will alleviate this problem and make the process efficient and user-friendly.

<!--
